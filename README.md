# HR Chatbot Project

This project implements an HR chatbot using Python. The chatbot extracts text from HR-related PDF documents, cleans the extracted text, and uses a generative AI model to answer user queries. Additionally, it includes a pre-defined FAQ section to handle common HR-related questions.

## Features

- **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from multiple PDF documents using `PyPDF2`.
- **Text Cleaning**: Cleans extracted text by removing non-alphabetic characters, converting to lowercase, and removing extra whitespaces.
- **Generative AI Integration**: Uses `google.generativeai` to configure and utilize a generative model for answering user questions.
- **Interactive Chatbot**: Provides an interactive CLI-based HR chatbot with options to view FAQs and ask questions.
